Please build a nextjs 15 app-router app which will be the platform for a regenerative art collective.
The idea is that artists can put their art on the platform as an NFT, artists will be offered to become educated and helped to mint their NFT and overcome the technical hurdles, the platform will also serve as a blog and the written articles should position the regenerative art collective as reshaping the art world in a positive light and allowing capital to be invested in art for regenerative purposes versus the classical use for tax evasion. 50% of every NFT art sale goes to the maintanance of the platform and creation of art residencies in regenerative communities, and the other 50% will go to the artist themselves.
There should be pages: /home /artists /art /regeneration

/home - landing page and a description of the idea
/artists - a page showing faces of the artists who are a part of the collective
/art - a page with placeholder NFTs that will eventually be replaced with the artists art
/regeneration - a description of the regenerative projects that the collective is working towards creating (a regenerative community in galicia)

Tech spec:

use app router
use tailwindcss
use swr where necessary
use typescript with implict any enabled
use https://ui.shadcn.com/ components
use https://ui.aceternity.com/components
Thanks!
